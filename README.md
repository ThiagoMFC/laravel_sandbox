This is a collection of random stuff made using Laravel hence the name Laravel Sandbox.

There is a basic CRUD application mimicking social media platforms (post, comment, follow, etc etc etc...)

There is a battleship-like game where the user is randomly assigned a set number of ships with various sizes and he has to guess their location on the board

And there is an ever growing collection of small random challenges (RandomController)
